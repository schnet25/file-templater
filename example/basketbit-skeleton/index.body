<h1>Welcome to Basketbit Software Systems</h1>
<p>
We are a computer engineering company with a heavy interest in the open source community.

For the time being, this site is admittedly boring.
However, you should check out our (slightly) more exciting <a href="http://wiki.basketbit.com">wiki</a> page.
Most of our configuration and troubleshooting notes reside there.
It even has a tutorial (with source code) on how I setup this website.

Thanks for visiting!
